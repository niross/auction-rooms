Auction Rooms
=============

Hotel Room Auctions!

This project was written by me as a proof of concept and a way to get aquainted with django-channels. The idea was to allow hotels to auction off spare rooms as a way to generate leads and boost their occupancy rates.

The backend uses Django (GeoDjango specifically) with postgres and makes use of django-channels for websocket support for live auctions.

The front end is built using a mixture of standard django templates interspersed with various react components.


Demo
